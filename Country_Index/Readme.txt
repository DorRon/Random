Python programmed SQLite3 "database" for information on countries including:
1) Year founded
2) Size in square Miles
3) Type of Government
4) Population
5) Currency
6) Official Language
7) Capital City
Countries are numbered and are in alphabetical order.
The information in the database is presented in a table design.

I recommend the usage of SQLite Database Browser to view the .db file but there are other alternatives out there.
